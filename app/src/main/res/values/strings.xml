    <string name="explanation1">League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful
        champions face off to destroy the otherâ€™s base. You get to choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays,
        secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation2">140+? that\'s a lot!!. I know and I am here to help you :). I have curated about 5
        champions for each lane in summoner\'s rift. Let\'s first discuss the lanes so we can determine which one is the
        best fit for you!
    </string>
    <string name="explanation3">------------Top lane:------------ It\'s primarily for tanky or durable champions known
        as top laners who excel at solo survival and one-on-one combat.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation4">-------------Mid lane:------------- It\'s reserved for mages and assassins who excel in
        burst damage and can swiftly influence other parts of the map.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation5">-------------Bot lane:------------- Played by ranged champions who aim to become
        powerful damage dealers in the later stages of the game.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation6">------------Support:------------ Supports assist the AD Carry by providing protection,
        engaging enemies, and controlling vision on the map.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation7">------------Jungle:------------ Junglers support lanes by clearing jungle camps for
        resources, controlling game objectives, and initiating surprise attacks (ganks).
    </string>
